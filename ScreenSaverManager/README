This is a simple ScreenSaver for Android.

1.To use this app,one must apply the patches to Android framework(framework/base/{core,services}).
  These two patches maybe only works for my Android version exactly, but you can get some thoughts
  from them.
2.The APP part of of this DIR uses a specific live wallpaper as screensaver, and most of this code
  is insipired by packages/wallpapers/LivePicker.
